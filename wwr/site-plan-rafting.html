    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our website's mission is to facilitate the learning of mathematics using the Twi language, 
        a widely spoken Akan dialect native to Ghana, a West African country known for its rich cultural tapestry and vibrant history. 
        Twi is primarily spoken by the Akan ethnic group, which includes the Ashanti, Fante, Akuapem, and other related ethnicities. 
        We recognize the immense cultural and historical significance of Twi within Ghana, making it an ideal medium to teach mathematics 
        and empower individuals within this linguistic and cultural context. 
        Our goal is to leverage Twi's roots and prevalence, creating an inclusive and effective learning environment where mathematical concepts 
        are explained, exercises are provided, and educational content is presented exclusively in this important language. 
        By doing so, we aim to empower the Twi-speaking community to grasp mathematical principles, fostering enhanced numeracy, critical thinking skills, and academic success while celebrating the beauty 
        of the Twi language and its rich heritage within the Ghanaian society.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>To our cherished audience, We extend a warm welcome to each and every one of you who seek to embrace the world of mathematics through the beauty of the Twi language. 
        Mathematics is a universal language, and by presenting it in Twi, we aim to honor the cultural richness and heritage of the Akan people, who have nurtured this vibrant language over generations. 
        Our dedication lies in providing a platform that not only imparts mathematical knowledge but does so in a language that holds a deep connection to the hearts and minds of many. 
        Twi is more than just words; it's a reflection of tradition, history, and identity. It's an invitation to learn and grow, embracing the numerical wonders in a way that feels natural and familiar. 
        By learning mathematics in Twi, we empower you to grasp complex concepts with clarity and confidence, unlocking the doors to a world of possibilities. We invite you to join us on this educational journey, 
        where the power of numbers and the beauty of language converge to elevate your understanding and appreciation of both mathematics and Twi. 
        Let's embark on this path together, celebrating the unique essence of Twi and the fascinating realm of mathematics. Akwaaba! (Welcome!)</p>
