      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>"Akwaaba!! I am Mensah Godfred, and this website's purpose is to revolutionize the teaching of mathematics by delivering it in Twi, 
        a widely spoken language in Ghana. Mathematics is a vital subject, yet the gap between teaching and learning persists. 
        This initiative aims to bridge this gap by imparting mathematical knowledge to the younger generation in Twi, 
        making it more accessible and comprehensible, ultimately fostering a stronger foundation in mathematics."</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>"The intended audience for this project encompasses students, educators, and parents within Ghana, 
        specifically those whose primary language is Twi. 
        This initiative tailors to individuals seeking to enhance their understanding of mathematics in their native language. 
        By providing educational materials and resources in Twi, we empower students in their academic pursuits and 
        enable parents and educators to actively support effective learning. 
        This project focuses on the Twi-speaking community, striving to make mathematics more accessible and enjoyable, 
        thereby promoting educational achievement and nurturing a love for learning among our target audience."</p>  <!-- change this -->
