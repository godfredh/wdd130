                        The reason visitors will choose our site over others to get this information or complete these actions is 
                        primarily due to our unique focus on delivering mathematical content in Twi. 
                        This sets us apart from traditional educational websites that predominantly use English or other languages. 
                        For the Twi-speaking community in Ghana, the opportunity to learn, teach, 
                        or support the learning of mathematics in their native language is a distinct advantage. 
                        Additionally, our website aims to foster a sense of community and shared learning experiences, 
                        providing a supportive environment that may not be readily available on other platforms.
